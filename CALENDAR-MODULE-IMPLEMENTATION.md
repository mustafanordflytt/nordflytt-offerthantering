# Calendar Module - Production Implementation

## Overview
The Calendar module has been fully integrated with the database and authentication system, replacing mock data with real Supabase integration. This provides comprehensive scheduling, resource management, and staff availability tracking.

## Database Schema

### 1. Main Calendar Tables

#### calendar_events
Core table for all calendar events:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- event_id (VARCHAR) - Unique identifier (EVENT000001 format)
- title, description
- event_type (job, meeting, training, break, vacation, other)
- event_status (scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- start_datetime, end_datetime (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- all_day (BOOLEAN)
- recurring, recurrence_rule
- job_id, customer_id (references)
- assigned_staff (UUID[])
- location fields (name, address, lat, lng)
- metadata (color, priority, tags, attachments)
- reminder_minutes (INTEGER[])
- audit fields (created_by, updated_by, timestamps)
```

#### calendar_attendees
Meeting participants and invitations:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- event_id (FK)
- user_id or external_email/name
- status (pending, accepted, declined, tentative)
- role (organizer, required, optional, attendee)
- responded_at, notes
```

#### calendar_resources
Equipment, vehicles, and rooms:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- resource_name, resource_type
- capacity, location, description

- metadata (JSONB)
```

#### calendar_resource_bookings
Resource reservations:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- event_id, resource_id (FKs)
- status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)
- notes
```

## Frontend Integration

### 1. Calendar Page Updates
The calendar page (`/app/crm/kalender/page.tsx`) now:
- Uses real API endpoints with authentication
- Displays events in month/week/day views
- Shows resource management interface
- Provides staff availability checking
- Supports event creation with conflict detection
- Real-time updates every minute

### 2. Key Features

#### Month View
- Color-coded events by type
- Click on events to check availability
- Shows up to 3 events per day
- Current day highlighting

#### Resources View
- Grouped by type (vehicles, rooms, equipment)
- Real-time availability status
- Current booking information
- Staff availability display with progress bars

#### Event Creation
- Modal dialog for new events
- Type selection with appropriate fields
- Date/time validation
- Location input
- Staff assignment (future enhancement)

## Advanced Features

### 1. Conflict Detection
Function `check_calendar_conflicts`:
- Checks for overlapping events
- Considers staff assignments
- Returns conflicting event details
- Used before creating/updating events

### 2. Auto-sync with Jobs
Database triggers automatically:
- Create calendar events when jobs are scheduled
- Update job status when calendar event changes
- Maintain consistency between systems

### 3. Staff Availability Calculation
Function `get_staff_availability`:
- Checks staff conflicts for given time
- Returns availability percentage
- Sorted by availability
- Considers working hours

### 4. Resource Utilization
Automatic calculation of:
- Usage rate over 30 days
- Peak usage times
- Availability forecasting

## Security Implementation

### 1. Row Level Security
All tables have RLS enabled:
- View permissions for all CRM users
- Create/update based on role and ownership
- Delete restricted to admins/creators

### 2. Permission Hierarchy
- **View**: All authenticated CRM users
- **Create**: Users with jobs:write permission
- **Update**: Event creator, assigned staff, managers
- **Delete**: Event creator (non-job events), admins

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Indexes
Created for optimal performance:
- start_datetime, end_datetime
- event_type, event_status
- job_id, customer_id
- GIN index on assigned_staff array
- attendee and booking foreign keys

### 2. Query Optimization
- Selective field loading
- Efficient date range queries
- Minimized JOIN operations
- Client-side caching with 1-minute refresh

## Sample Resources
Pre-populated resources:
- Lastbil 1, 2 (vehicles)
- Sk√•pbil 1 (vehicle)
- Konferensrum A, B (rooms)

## Migration Notes

### Before:
- Mock calendar data
- No resource management
- Basic event display
- No conflict checking

### After:
- Full database persistence
- Resource booking system
- Staff availability tracking
- Automatic conflict detection
- Integration with jobs system

## Testing

1. Create calendar event:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/crm/calendar/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Team Meeting",
    "type": "meeting",
    "start": "2025-01-10T10:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-01-10T11:00:00Z"
  }'
```

2. Check availability:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/crm/calendar/availability?date=2025-01-10"
```

3. List resources:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/crm/calendar/resources
```
