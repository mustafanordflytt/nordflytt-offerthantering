# Investigation Report: Maria Johansson's Test Order (BOOK1001)

## Summary
Maria Johansson's test order (BOOK1001) is **NOT visible** in any of the CRM pages because it was never successfully saved to the database.

## Investigation Results

### 1. CRM Pages Status

#### Offerter (Offers) Page - `/crm/offerter`
- **Status**: ❌ Maria's booking NOT visible
- **Total offers shown**: 0 (when table is empty, API returns 50 offers from database)
- **Data source**: Fetches from Supabase `bookings` table via `/api/offers`
- **Issue**: Falls back to mock data when no database connection

#### Leads Page - `/crm/leads`
- **Status**: ❌ Maria's booking NOT visible
- **Total leads shown**: 2 (mock data only)
- **Data source**: Returns hardcoded mock data via `/api/crm/leads`
- **Mock leads**: "Potential Customer 1" and "Potential Customer 2"
- **Issue**: Not connected to real database

#### Kalender (Calendar) Page - `/crm/kalender`
- **Status**: ❌ Maria's booking NOT visible
- **Total jobs shown**: 5 (from database)
- **Data source**: Fetches from Supabase `bookings` table via `/api/crm/jobs`
- **Issue**: Maria's booking was never saved to database

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

When attempting to create Maria's booking through the `/api/submit-booking` endpoint:
- **Response**: Success (but with issues)
- **Booking ID**: `null` (indicates database save failed)
- **Reference**: Generated but not linked to database record
- **Notifications**: Sent successfully (email & SMS)

The booking creation failed at the database level because:
1. The Supabase connection appears to be misconfigured
2. When database operations fail, the API still returns success but with `bookingId: null`
3. Without a database record, the booking cannot appear in any CRM views

### 3. Database Query Results

Direct queries to the Supabase database for:
- Customer name containing "Maria"
- Email containing "maria"
- Reference "BOOK1001"

All returned **0 results**, confirming the booking was never saved.

### 4. API Responses

```javascript
// Offers API
Total offers: 50 (from other customers like "mustafa abdulkarim")
Maria's offers: 0

// Leads API  
Total leads: 2 (mock data only)
Maria's leads: 0

// Jobs API
Total jobs: 5 (real bookings from database)
Maria's jobs: 0
```

## Recommendations

### To Make Maria's Booking Visible:

1. **Fix Database Connection**
   - Verify Supabase environment variables in `.env.local`
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct
   - Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for API routes

2. **Create Maria's Booking Properly**
   - Use the Supabase test page at `/test-supabase` to verify connection
   - Manually insert Maria's booking into the `bookings` table
   - Or fix the `/api/submit-booking` endpoint to properly save to database

3. **Update Mock Data** (Quick workaround)
   - Add Maria to the mock data in `/api/offers/route.ts` (line 78-172)
   - Add Maria to the mock data in `/api/crm/leads/route.ts` (line 4-37)
   - Add Maria to the mock data in `/api/crm/jobs/route.ts` (line 93-187)

### Current Data Flow:
```
Form Submission → /api/submit-booking → Database Save (FAILS) → No CRM visibility
                                     ↓
                              Notifications sent
                              (Email & SMS work)
```

## Screenshots Captured
- `crm-main-page.png` - Main CRM dashboard
- `crm-offerter-page.png` - Offers page (empty table)
- `crm-leads-page.png` - Leads page (2 mock leads)
- `crm-kalender-page.png` - Calendar page (5 real jobs, no Maria)

## Conclusion
Maria Johansson's test order is not visible because it was never successfully saved to the database. The system needs proper Supabase configuration to persist bookings, which will then make them visible across all CRM pages.
