# FINAL FIX: Jobs Without customer_name Column

## Root Cause
The code was trying to insert `customer_name` into the bookings table, but that column doesn't exist. The bookings table only has:
- `customer_id` (reference to customers table)
- `customer_email`
- `customer_phone`
- NO `customer_name` column!

## Critical Discovery
Jobs are NOT separate entities - they are just bookings with status: confirmed/in_progress/completed

## The Correct Solution

### 1. Job Creation = Status Update Only
```javascript
// DON'T insert new rows or add columns
// DO update existing booking status
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .update({
    status: 'confirmed',
    confirmed_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', bookingId);
```

### 2. Customer Name via JOIN
The `/api/crm/jobs` endpoint gets customer name through a JOIN:
```javascript
const { data: bookings } = await supabase
  .from('bookings')
  .select(`
    *,
    customer:customers(
      id,
      name,      // <-- Customer name comes from here!
      email,
      phone
    )
  `)
  .in('status', ['confirmed', 'in_progress', 'completed']);
```

### 3. Job Display Structure
The API transforms the joined data:
```javascript
{
  bookingNumber: booking.reference || 'NF-...',
  customerName: booking.customer?.name || 'Unknown',  // From JOIN!
  fromAddress: booking.start_address,
  toAddress: booking.end_address,
  // ... rest of job fields
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **Booking Created** → Has customer_id (not name)
2. **Booking Confirmed** → Status updated to 'confirmed' (becomes a job)
3. **Jobs API Called** → Queries bookings with customer JOIN
4. **Transform Data** → Creates job structure with customerName from JOIN
5. **UI Displays** → Shows complete job with customer name

## Key Points

✅ NO customer_name column in bookings table  
✅ Jobs = Bookings with confirmed status  
✅ Customer name comes from JOIN with customers table  
✅ No need to modify table structure  
✅ Existing jobs (Anna Andersson, Företaget AB) work this way  

## Updated Files

1. `/lib/utils/job-creation.ts` - Removed customer_name insertion
2. `/lib/utils/job-creation-v2.ts` - Created correct implementation
3. `/app/api/crm/jobs/route.ts` - Already correctly JOINs customer data

## Test Command

```bash
node test-no-customer-name.cjs
```

This will verify:
- Job creation works without customer_name column
- Jobs appear correctly in /crm/uppdrag
- Customer names display properly via JOIN
