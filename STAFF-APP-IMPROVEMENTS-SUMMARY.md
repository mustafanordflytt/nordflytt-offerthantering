# üöÄ Staff App Improvements Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Job Display & Date Filtering** 
**Problem**: Jobs weren't showing up ("Inga uppdrag idag")
**Solution**: 
- Added initial `loadTodaysJobs()` call in dashboard
- Implemented proper date filtering using `moveDate` field
- Updated API to filter jobs by date parameter
- Jobs now properly filtered to show only today's assignments

**Code Changes**:
- `/app/api/staff/jobs/route.ts`: Added date filtering logic
- `/app/staff/dashboard/page.tsx`: Synced realtimeJobs with todaysJobs

### 2. **GPS Modal UX Enhancement**
**Problem**: GPS confirmation modal was too intrusive and confusing
**Solution**:
- Redesigned modal with "Starta √§nd√•" as primary green button
- Made "Aktivera GPS" secondary
- Improved button styling and touch targets (44px minimum)
- Better messaging about GPS benefits

**Code Changes**:
- `/lib/time-tracking.ts`: Updated modal HTML and button order

### 3. **Cookie Banner Removal**
**Problem**: Cookie consent banner appeared on staff pages
**Solution**:
- Added check to skip cookie banner on `/staff/*` routes
- Staff can work without interruption

**Code Changes**:
- `/components/CookieConsent.tsx`: Added pathname check

### 4. **Camera Fallback for HTTP/Mobile**
**Problem**: Camera didn't work without HTTPS
**Solution**:
- Created camera choice modal for mobile/HTTP environments
- Options: "Anv√§nd kamera" or "V√§lj fr√•n galleri"
- File input fallback with proper photo metadata
- Maintains GPS and timestamp data even with file upload

**Code Changes**:
- `/app/staff/utils/serviceSpecific.ts`: Enhanced `cameraHandler` with fallback logic

### 5. **HTTPS Testing Setup**
**Problem**: Needed HTTPS for full camera functionality
**Solution**:
- Created ngrok setup script
- Comprehensive testing guide
- Automated test scripts

**New Files**:
- `setup-ngrok.sh`: Downloads and configures ngrok
- `HTTPS-TESTING-GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step testing instructions
- `test-improvements-complete.js`: Automated verification script

## üì± Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (HTTP)
