- [ ] All touch targets minimum 44px
- [ ] Content readable on mobile devices
- [ ] Forms work on touch devices
- [ ] Quick access features functional

### **7. Error Handling**
- [ ] 404 pages handled gracefully
- [ ] Network errors caught and displayed
- [ ] JavaScript errors don't crash app
- [ ] Error boundaries working in Swedish
- [ ] Fallback states for loading failures

### **8. Performance**
- [ ] Dashboard loads under 5 seconds
- [ ] Navigation transitions smooth
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] No memory leaks on extended use
- [ ] Reasonable bundle size

## 🧪 **Automated Testing**

### **Run Test Suite**
```bash
# Install Playwright if needed
npm install playwright

# Run comprehensive test suite
node tests/crm-production-test.js

# Or run in visible browser mode for debugging
HEADLESS=false node tests/crm-production-test.js
```

### **Manual Testing Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: New User Onboarding**
1. Navigate to `/crm/login`
2. Try invalid login → Should show error
3. Login as employee → Should succeed
4. Navigate around CRM → Should see appropriate permissions
5. Try admin-only page → Should be restricted

#### **Scenario 2: Daily Operations**
1. Login as manager
2. Check dashboard metrics
3. Create new customer
4. Convert lead to customer  
5. Create job from customer
6. Update job status
7. Verify activity log updates

#### **Scenario 3: Mobile Usage**
1. Open on mobile device (375px width)
2. Use mobile navigation menu
3. Complete basic tasks (view customers, update job)
4. Verify all buttons are tappable
5. Test form submissions

#### **Scenario 4: Error Scenarios**
1. Disconnect network → App should handle gracefully
2. Force JavaScript error → Error boundary should catch
3. Access unauthorized endpoint → Should redirect or show error
4. Submit invalid form data → Should show validation

## 🔧 **Production Configuration**

### **Environment Variables (.env.production)**
```bash
# Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-here

# Features
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production
```

### **Deployment Steps**
1. **Build Check**: `npm run build` (should complete without errors)
2. **Database Migration**: Run both CRM migrations
3. **Environment Setup**: Configure production environment variables
4. **Test Deploy**: Deploy to staging environment first
5. **Run Tests**: Execute full test suite against staging
6. **Go Live**: Deploy to production
7. **Smoke Test**: Quick verification of critical paths
