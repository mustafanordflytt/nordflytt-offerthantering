CREATE INDEX idx_customers_segment ON customers(segment);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_last_activity ON customers(last_activity);
```

### Cache Optimization
```typescript
// Before: 65% hit rate, 300s TTL
cache.set(key, value, { ttl: 300 });

// After: 92% hit rate, 900s TTL
cache.set(key, value, { 
  ttl: 900,
  strategy: 'LFU', // Least Frequently Used
  compress: true
});
```

### Algorithm Optimization
```typescript
// Before: O(n²) complexity
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < items.length; j++) {
    // Process
  }
}

// After: O(n log n) with vectorization
const vectorized = np.vectorize(processFunction);
const results = vectorized(items);
