## 💡 ADVANCED AUTOMATION FEATURES

### Smart Scheduling Algorithm
```typescript
// TSP with 2-opt improvement
function optimizeRoute(jobs: Job[]): Job[] {
  let route = nearestNeighbor(jobs);
  let improved = true;
  
  while (improved) {
    improved = false;
    for (let i = 1; i < route.length - 2; i++) {
      for (let j = i + 1; j < route.length; j++) {
        if (shouldSwap(route, i, j)) {
          route = perform2OptSwap(route, i, j);
          improved = true;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  return route;
}
```

### Dynamic Pricing Formula
```typescript
OptimalPrice = BasePrice × (1 + Σ(Adjustments))
Where:
- Demand Adjustment = 0.15 × DemandLevel
- Urgency Multiplier = 1.0 - 2.0
- Seasonal Factor = 0.65 - 1.35
- Competition Position = ±10%
- Customer Segment = -8% to +5%
```

### Assignment Scoring
```typescript
TeamScore = Σ(Factor × Weight)
- SkillMatch: perfectMatch ? 1.0 : matchRatio + expertBonus
- Proximity: max(0, 1 - distance/50km)
- Availability: slotMatch × capacityScore
- Performance: historical × specialization
- Workload: 1 - (current/max)
```
