# Leads Module - Production Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Leads module has been enhanced to production readiness with complete database integration, authentication, and advanced features for lead management.

## Database Schema Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Leads Table
Added missing columns to align with frontend requirements:
- `name` - Lead's full name
- `email` - Contact email
- `phone` - Contact phone
- `company_name` - Company name (for B2B leads)
- `estimated_value` - Estimated deal value
- `expected_close_date` - Expected closing date
- `lead_score` - Automatic scoring (0-100)
- `tags` - Array of tags for categorization
- `metadata` - JSONB for flexible data storage
- `created_by` / `updated_by` - Audit trail

### 2. New Supporting Tables

#### lead_activities
Tracks all interactions with leads:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- lead_id (FK)
- type (call, email, meeting, note, task)
- title
- description
- completed (boolean)
- completed_at
- due_date
- created_by
- created_at
```

#### lead_source_tracking
Analytics for lead sources:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- lead_id (FK)
- source
- medium

- utm_params (JSONB)
```

#### lead_status_history
Tracks pipeline movement:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- lead_id (FK)
- old_status
- new_status
- changed_by
- reason

```

#### lead_assignments
Assignment history:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- lead_id (FK)

```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Main Leads API (`/api/crm/leads`)

    "totalValue": 2500000,
    "avgLeadScore": 65,
    "conversionRate": 10
  }
}
```

#### POST - Create Lead
Features:
- Validation for required fields (name + email/phone)
- Email format validation
- Automatic lead ID generation (LEAD000001 format)
- Initial activity logging
- Source tracking with UTM parameters
- Auto-assignment option

### 2. Individual Lead API (`/api/crm/leads/[id]`)

#### GET - Get Lead Details
Features:
- Complete lead information
- Related customer and offer data
- Full activity history with creator names
- Status change history
- Detailed statistics (days since creation, etc.)

#### PUT - Update Lead
Features:
- Partial updates supported
- Automatic status history logging
- Assignment tracking
- Activity creation on update
- Last contact date tracking

#### DELETE - Delete Lead
Features:
- Prevents deletion of converted leads
- Cascade deletion of related records
- Proper error handling

## Advanced Features

### 1. Lead Scoring Algorithm
Automatic scoring based on:
- Estimated value (up to 30 points)
- Lead source (5-25 points based on quality)
- Status progression (0-40 points)
- Activity count (up to 20 points)
- Recency (up to 10 points)
- Maximum score: 100

### 2. Auto-Assignment
- Finds user with least active leads
- Only assigns to active users (admin, manager, employee)
- Logs assignment in history

### 3. Lead Conversion
Function to convert leads to customers:
- Creates customer record
- Updates lead status to 'closed_won'
- Maintains audit trail
- Links customer to lead

### 4. Database Triggers
- **Lead Score Update**: Automatically recalculates on changes
- **Status History**: Logs all status changes
- **Timestamp Updates**: Auto-updates `updated_at`

## Security Implementation

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)
Applied to all new tables:
- CRM users can view all lead data
- Users can only update their own activities
- Managers/admins have elevated permissions

### 2. Authentication Flow
- Bearer token support
- Session cookie support
- Demo mode fallback
- Role-based permissions

## Data Migration
- Status values normalized to match frontend
- Swedish status names converted to English
- Sample data inserted for testing

## Frontend Integration Points

### Key Changes for Frontend:
1. Lead IDs are now strings (database returns integers, API converts)
2. `assignedTo` returns user name, not ID
3. Activities include creator names
4. All dates converted to Date objects
5. Statistics provided in API responses

### Required Frontend Updates:
- Update TypeScript interfaces to match new data structure
- Handle activity arrays in lead details
- Use new stats object for dashboards
- Implement status history display

## Testing Checklist

✅ Database migration runs successfully
✅ All indexes created for performance
✅ RLS policies active
✅ Authentication validates properly
✅ CRUD operations work correctly
✅ Lead scoring calculates automatically
✅ Status history tracks changes
✅ Auto-assignment distributes fairly
✅ Lead conversion creates customers
✅ Filtering and search work
✅ Pagination handles large datasets

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Indexes Created**:
   - name, email, phone (for search)
   - estimated_value, expected_close_date (for sorting)
   - lead_score (for filtering)
   - All foreign keys

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Selective field loading
   - Efficient JOIN operations
   - Pagination to limit result sets

## Next Steps

1. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Implement WebSocket notifications
   - Live lead score updates
   - Activity stream

2. **Enhanced Analytics**:
   - Conversion funnel visualization
   - Source ROI tracking
   - Team performance metrics

3. **Automation**:
   - Email sequence triggers
   - Follow-up reminders
   - Lead nurturing workflows

## Migration Guide

To deploy these changes:

1. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. Update environment variables:
   ```
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
   ```

3. Test authentication:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        http://localhost:3000/api/crm/leads
   ```

4. Verify lead creation:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/crm/leads \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        -d '{"name":"Test Lead","email":"test@example.com"}'
   ```

## Known Issues & Solutions

1. **Issue**: Frontend expects different date formats
   **Solution**: API converts all dates to ISO strings

2. **Issue**: Some status values don't match
   **Solution**: Migration normalizes all status values

3. **Issue**: User assignments show IDs instead of names
   **Solution**: API fetches and returns user names

This completes the Leads module production implementation.
