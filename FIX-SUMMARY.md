# ðŸ”§ Fix Applied - useRecruitmentMetrics Hook

## Issue Fixed
The `useRecruitmentMetrics` hook had an unnecessary import of Supabase that was causing build/runtime errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `hooks/useRecruitmentMetrics.ts`
- **Removed:** Unused `import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase';`
- **Result:** Hook now only imports what it actually uses

### 2. Updated Test Script
- **File:** `test-lowisa-api-endpoints.cjs`
- **Change:** Commented out `node-fetch` import (Node.js 18+ has native fetch)

## To Run Your Server

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Or if using yarn
yarn dev

# Or if using pnpm
pnpm dev
```

## To Test the API Endpoints

```bash
# If using Node.js 18+
node test-lowisa-api-endpoints.cjs

# If using older Node.js, first install node-fetch:
npm install node-fetch
# Then uncomment the require line in the test file
```

## Verify Everything Works

1. **Server should start without errors**
2. **Recruitment page should load:** http://localhost:3000/crm/rekrytering
3. **API endpoints should respond to test script**

The issue is now resolved! The hook was importing Supabase but not using it, which could cause issues if Supabase environment variables weren't set up. Now it only imports what it needs.
