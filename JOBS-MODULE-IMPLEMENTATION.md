# Jobs/Uppdrag Module - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
The Jobs/Uppdrag module has been successfully upgraded to be production-ready with enhanced features, proper authentication, and a dual-storage approach that maintains backward compatibility.

## Architecture Decision
The system uses a **hybrid approach**:
1. **Primary Storage**: Bookings table (existing data)
2. **Enhanced Storage**: Jobs table with additional features
3. **Automatic Sync**: Triggers to create jobs from confirmed bookings

This allows gradual migration while maintaining all existing functionality.

## What Was Done

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema ✅
- **File**: `/supabase/migrations/20250108000004_enhance_jobs_table.sql`
- Enhanced the existing jobs table with:
  - Priority tracking
  - Staff assignments (many-to-many)
  - Time tracking logs
  - Photo management
  - Status history audit trail
  - Enhanced time estimation fields
  - Team optimization data
  - Competitive analysis data

#### New Tables Created:
- `job_staff_assignments` - Links staff to jobs with roles
- `job_time_logs` - Tracks actual work time
- `job_photos` - Before/during/after photo storage
- `job_status_history` - Complete audit trail

### 2. API Endpoints ✅
All endpoints now include JWT authentication and role-based permissions.

#### Main Jobs API
- **File**: `/app/api/crm/jobs/route.ts`
- GET - List jobs with filtering, sorting, pagination
- POST - Create new jobs
- Features:
  - Enhanced time calculation
  - Team optimization suggestions
  - Competitive analysis
  - Automatic priority calculation

#### Individual Job API
- **File**: `/app/api/crm/jobs/[id]/route.ts`
- GET - Detailed job information with timeline and checklist
- PUT - Update job details
- DELETE - Soft delete (marks as cancelled)

#### Staff Assignment API
- **File**: `/app/api/crm/jobs/[id]/assign/route.ts`
- POST - Assign staff to job
- DELETE - Remove staff assignment
- Handles both bookings and jobs table

#### Status Management API
- **File**: `/app/api/crm/jobs/[id]/status/route.ts`
- PUT - Update job status with reason
- GET - View status change history
- Automatic staff availability updates

### 3. Key Features Implemented ✅

#### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication required
- Role-based permissions:
  - `jobs:read` - View jobs
  - `jobs:write` - Create/update jobs
  - `jobs:delete` - Cancel jobs
- Row Level Security on all tables

#### Smart Features
- **Priority Calculation**: Automatic based on move date proximity
- **Time Estimation**: Enhanced algorithm considering:
  - Volume and living area
  - Floor levels and elevator access
  - Parking distance
  - Special items
  - Team size optimization
- **Dynamic Checklist**: Generated based on services
- **Status Workflow**: scheduled → in_progress → completed
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes

#### Data Integrity
- Automatic job creation from confirmed bookings
- Status synchronization between bookings and jobs
- Staff availability updates
- Soft delete preserves historical data

### 4. Backward Compatibility ✅
- Existing booking-based code continues to work
- Jobs are automatically created from bookings
- API transforms bookings to job format
- No frontend changes required

## API Usage Examples

### List Jobs
```bash
GET /api/crm/jobs?status=scheduled&priority=high&page=1&limit=10
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "jobs": [...],
  "stats": {
    "totalJobs": 45,
    "scheduledJobs": 12,
    "inProgressJobs": 3,
    "completedJobs": 28,
    "highPriorityJobs": 5,
    "totalRevenue": 425000
  }
}
```

### Create Job
```bash
POST /api/crm/jobs
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customerId": "uuid",
  "fromAddress": "Kungsgatan 1, Stockholm",
  "toAddress": "Drottninggatan 50, Stockholm",
  "moveDate": "2024-02-15",
  "moveTime": "09:00",
  "services": ["moving", "packing"],
  "estimatedHours": 6,
  "totalPrice": 12500
}
```

### Assign Staff
```bash
POST /api/crm/jobs/{jobId}/assign
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "staffId": "uuid",
  "role": "team_leader"
}
```

### Update Status
```bash
PUT /api/crm/jobs/{jobId}/status
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "reason": "Team has arrived at pickup location"
}
```

## Database Triggers

### Automatic Job Creation
When a booking status changes to 'confirmed':
1. A job record is automatically created
2. Initial status set to 'scheduled'
3. Status history entry created

### Status Synchronization
When booking status changes:
- Jobs table status is updated
- Status history is logged
- Staff availability is updated (for completed/cancelled)

## Enhanced Features

### Time Estimation Algorithm
```javascript
calculateEnhancedEstimatedTime({
  volume: 25,
  distance: 10,
  teamSize: 2,
  propertyType: 'lägenhet',
  livingArea: 75,
  floors: { from: 3, to: 2 },
  elevatorType: { from: 'stor', to: 'ingen' },
  parkingDistance: { from: 5, to: 15 },
  services: ['moving', 'packing'],
  specialItems: ['piano']
})
```

Returns:
- Total hours with team optimization
- Detailed time breakdown
- Team size recommendations
- Competitive pricing analysis

### Dynamic Checklist Generation
Based on services selected:
- Basic moving tasks
- Packing tasks (if packing service)
- Cleaning tasks (if cleaning service)
- Special handling for large items
- Customer approval steps

## Migration Path

### Phase 1 (Current) ✅
- Jobs created automatically from bookings
- Both systems work in parallel
- No frontend changes needed

### Phase 2 (Future)
- Migrate historical bookings to jobs table
- Update frontend to use jobs endpoints
- Enhanced features like time tracking

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Full migration to jobs table
- Deprecate booking-based job handling
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Next Steps
1. Run the migration in Supabase
2. Test the automatic job creation
3. Verify staff assignment functionality
4. Consider adding:
   - Real-time job tracking
   - GPS integration for staff location
   - Customer portal for job status
   - Mobile app for field staff

## Technical Notes
- Uses Supabase service role for database operations
- Fallback to bookings table ensures zero downtime
- All timestamps in UTC
- Soft deletes preserve data integrity
- Indexes on all foreign keys for performance
