# Customers Module - Production Implementation

## Overview
The Customers module has been fully integrated with the database and authentication system, replacing mock data with real Supabase integration.

## Database Schema Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Customers Table
Added new columns to support comprehensive customer management:
- `status` - Customer status (active, inactive, deleted)
- `notes` - Internal notes about the customer
- `tags` - Array of tags for categorization
- `metadata` - JSONB for flexible data storage
- `created_by` / `updated_by` - Audit trail

### 2. New Supporting Tables

#### customer_activities
Tracks all interactions with customers:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- customer_id (FK)
- type (call, email, meeting, note, booking)
- title
- description
- activity_date
- created_by
```

#### customer_documents
Stores customer-related documents:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- customer_id (FK)
- document_type (contract, invoice, agreement, other)
- document_name
- file_url
- file_size
- mime_type
- uploaded_by
```

#### customer_notes
Detailed notes system:
```sql
- id (UUID)
- customer_id (FK)
- note_type (general, complaint, feedback, request)
- content
- is_internal
- created_by
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Main Customers API (`/api/crm/customers`)

#### GET - List Customers
Features:
- JWT authentication required
- Permission check: `customers:read`
- Advanced filtering:
  - By type (private/business)
  - By status (active/inactive/deleted)
  - Full-text search
- Pagination support
- Aggregated statistics per customer
- Performance optimized with indexes

Response includes:
```json
{
  "customers": [...],
  "stats": {
    "totalCustomers": 150,
    "activeCustomers": 145,
    "privateCustomers": 100,
    "businessCustomers": 50,
    "totalRevenue": 2500000,
    "avgCustomerValue": 16667
  }
}
```

#### POST - Create Customer
Features:
- Required: name + (email OR phone)
- Email validation
- Duplicate check
- Auto-generates customer record
- Returns created customer

### 2. Individual Customer API (`/api/crm/customers/[id]`)

#### GET - Get Customer Details
Returns comprehensive customer information:
- Basic details
- Related bookings, jobs, offers, leads
- Activity history
- Calculated statistics
- Lifetime value

#### PUT - Update Customer
Features:
- Partial updates supported
- Email validation on change
- Duplicate email check
- Audit trail (updated_by, updated_at)

#### DELETE - Delete Customer
Features:
- Soft delete (status = 'deleted')
- Prevents deletion if active jobs exist
- Maintains data integrity

## Frontend Integration

### 1. Store Updates (`/lib/store.ts`)
- Updated `useCustomers` store to use real API
- Added proper authentication headers
- Async operations with error handling
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

### 2. Authentication Integration
- Created `token-helper.ts` for consistent auth headers
- Supports both Supabase session and legacy tokens
- Graceful fallback handling

## Advanced Features

### 1. Customer Lifetime Value
Automatic calculation function:
```sql
calculate_customer_lifetime_value(customer_id)
```
- Sums accepted offers
- Adds completed job values
- Used in statistics

### 2. Customer Statistics
Comprehensive stats function:
```sql
get_customer_statistics(customer_id)
```
Returns:
- Total bookings, jobs, offers
- Completed/accepted counts
- Average job value
- Last activity date

### 3. Activity Tracking
Automatic logging via database triggers:
- New booking creation
- Job completion
- Status changes

### 4. Data Validation
- Email format validation
- Required field checks
- Duplicate prevention
- Business rules enforcement

## Security Implementation

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS enabled:
- View permissions for all CRM users
- Write permissions based on role
- Update own records only (except admin/manager)

### 2. Permission Checks
Every API endpoint validates:
- Valid JWT token
- User has required permission
- Request scope matches user role

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Indexes
Created for optimal query performance:
- customer_email (unique)
- customer_type, status
- created_at for sorting
- GIN index on tags array

### 2. Query Optimization
- Selective field loading
- Aggregate queries for counts
- Efficient JOIN operations
- Pagination to limit data transfer

## Testing & Validation

### API Testing Examples:

1. List customers with auth:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/crm/customers
```

2. Create customer:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/crm/customers \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"name":"Test Customer","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

3. Update customer:
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/crm/customers/123 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"notes":"Updated notes"}'
```

## Migration from Mock Data

### Before:
- Customer data stored in localStorage
- No real persistence
- No relations or history
- Basic CRUD only

### After:
- Full database integration
- Complete audit trail
- Rich relationships
- Advanced features

## Next Steps

1. **File Upload Integration**
   - Implement document upload for customer_documents
   - Add file preview capabilities

2. **Activity Timeline**
   - Visual timeline of all customer interactions
   - Filter by activity type

3. **Bulk Operations**
   - Mass update customers
   - Bulk tag assignment
   - Export functionality

4. **Enhanced Search**
   - Elasticsearch integration
   - Fuzzy matching
   - Advanced filters

This completes the Customers module production implementation.
