# 🔄 Nordflytt CRM Workflow Mapping

## 📊 Current Workflow Status

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Booking → Offer/Quote Creation**
   - Booking form submission creates entries in `bookings` table
   - Customer records created/updated in `customers` table
   - Booking NF-23857BDE successfully synced to CRM
   - Offers visible in `/crm/offerter` page

2. **CRM Section Connectivity**
   - All CRM sections built and functional (42 files, 30k+ lines)
   - Manual navigation between sections works
   - Data can be viewed across sections

### ❌ Missing Automations

1. **Offer → Work Order (Uppdrag)**
   - ❌ NO automatic job creation when offer is accepted
   - Must manually create job via `/api/jobs` POST endpoint
   - No database triggers or webhooks set up

2. **Work Order → Calendar**
   - ❌ NO automatic calendar entry creation
   - Calendar (`/crm/kalender`) fetches jobs from `/api/crm/jobs`
   - Jobs appear in calendar ONLY if they exist in jobs table
   - No separate calendar_events table

3. **Calendar → Staff Notifications**
   - ❌ NO automatic staff notifications
   - No push notification system implemented
   - No email/SMS alerts to assigned staff
   - Staff must manually check calendar

## 🗺️ Current Data Flow

```
Customer Booking Form
       ↓
   [Automatic]
       ↓
Bookings Table + Customers Table
       ↓
   [Automatic via CRM sync]
       ↓
Quotes Table (Offers)
       ↓
   [MANUAL - Missing automation]
       ↓
Jobs Table (Work Orders)
       ↓
   [Jobs appear in calendar view]
       ↓
Calendar Page (Read-only view of jobs)
       ↓
   [MANUAL - No notifications]
       ↓
Staff check calendar manually
```

## 🔧 Integration Gaps

### 1. **Offer Acceptance Automation**
- **Current**: `/api/confirm-booking` updates booking status to 'confirmed' and quote to 'accepted'
- **Missing**: Trigger to create job/work order
- **Solution**: Add job creation logic to confirmation endpoint

### 2. **Job Creation to Calendar**
- **Current**: Jobs table serves as calendar data source
- **Missing**: Dedicated calendar events or proper scheduling system
- **Solution**: Jobs already appear in calendar - this is partially working

### 3. **Staff Notifications**
- **Current**: No notification system
- **Missing**: 
  - Push notifications
  - Email/SMS alerts
  - In-app notifications
- **Solution**: Implement notification service

## 📍 Booking NF-23857BDE Status

1. **Bookings Table**: ✅ Entry exists
2. **Customers Table**: ✅ Customer "Aaaa" linked
3. **Quotes/Offers**: ✅ Visible in `/crm/offerter`
4. **Jobs/Work Orders**: ❌ Not created (requires manual action)
5. **Calendar**: ❌ Not visible (no job exists)
6. **Staff Assignment**: ❌ No staff assigned

## 🚀 Required Actions

### Priority 1: Offer → Job Automation
```typescript
// Add to /api/confirm-booking/route.ts
if (result.success && booking.status === 'accepted') {
  // Create job automatically
  await createJobFromBooking(booking);
}
```

### Priority 2: Staff Notifications
```typescript
// Add to /api/jobs/route.ts POST method
if (data.assigned_staff?.length > 0) {
  await notifyAssignedStaff(data);
}
```

### Priority 3: Real-time Updates
- Implement WebSocket or polling for calendar updates
- Add notification badges to staff dashboard
- Create notification preferences system

## 📝 Summary

The CRM has all components built but lacks workflow automation:
- ✅ All UI sections complete
- ✅ Database structure in place
- ✅ Manual workflows functional
- ❌ Automated workflows missing
- ❌ Notification system not implemented
- ❌ Real-time updates not configured

**Next Steps**: Implement the missing automation layers to connect the existing components into a seamless workflow.
