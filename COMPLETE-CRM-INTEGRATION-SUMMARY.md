# Complete CRM Integration Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Data Consistency ✅
- **Offer Status**: Auto-updates to "Godkänd" when booking confirmed
- **Time Calculations**: Standardized to 6 hours for 28m³ (industry standard)
- **All Sections**: Show consistent data across CRM

### 2. Customer Lifecycle ✅
- **Customer Creation**: When booking submitted → Create/update customer
- **Lead Generation**: When offer created → Create lead with "new" status
- **Lead Conversion**: When offer accepted → Update lead to "converted"
- **Entity Linking**: All entities properly linked (customer ↔ lead ↔ offer ↔ job)

### 3. Database Integration ✅
- **Real Data**: APIs now fetch from database, not just mock data
- **Customer API**: `/api/crm/customers` shows real customers
- **Leads API**: `/api/crm/leads` shows real leads with status
- **Jobs API**: `/api/crm/jobs` shows confirmed bookings as jobs

## Complete Flow for NF-23857BDE

### 1. Booking Submission
```javascript
// Creates:
- Customer: mustafa abdulkarim (if not exists)
- Offer: NF-23857BDE with status "pending"
- Lead: With status "new" and offer reference
- Booking: For CRM compatibility
```

### 2. Offer Acceptance
```javascript
// Updates:
- Booking status → "confirmed"
- Offer status → "Godkänd"
- Lead status → "converted"
- Creates job (booking with confirmed status)
```

### 3. CRM Visibility
```
✅ /crm/kunder - mustafa abdulkarim appears as customer #4
✅ /crm/leads - Lead shows with "converted" status
✅ /crm/offerter - Offer shows with "Godkänd" status
✅ /crm/uppdrag - Job shows with 6 hours estimate

```
